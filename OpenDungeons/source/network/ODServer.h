/**
 * When playing single player or multiplayer, there is always one reference gamemap. It is
 * the one on ODServer. There is also a client gamemap in ODFrameListener which is supposed to be
 * a "copy" from the server gamemap containing only the useful information for the player.
 * The server has its own thread to update the server gamemap. When a relevant change occurs,
 * the server sends messages to the clients so that they know they should update the client gamemaps.
 * The server gamemap should only be accessed from the server thread because it is not thread safe.
 * and the server thread should never be used for calling functions from the client gamemap.
 * As a consequence, ODFrameListener.h should not be included is ODServer.cpp
 * Interactions between client and server gamemaps should only occur through client/server messages
 * by queuing messages (calling queueServerNotification).
 * Moreover, in processServerNotifications, no message should be sent directly to the clients (by
 * creating an ODPacket and sending it to the clients) because it would break the queue order. Instead,
 * queueServerNotification should be called with the message.
 * Note that this rule is not followed when dealing with client connexions or chat because there
 * is no need to synchronize such messages with the gamemap.
