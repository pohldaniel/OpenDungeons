/*! \brief The CullingManager class is a class to effectively
 *  manage culling methods used in game. So far there is only
 *  one algorithm included : it is supposed to cull the Tiles.
 *  It should be started with the method startTileCulling.

 * Currently I try to implement the most general polygon rasterizing algorithm , that is :
 * 1. We choose the max and min points due to their Y value .
 * 2. We sort all the points by the angle value in it's polar representation
 * ( that is going , by visiting them clockwise due to the center of the polygon )
 * 3. Now we have two paths from which we can walk from top to down vertices : call them left and right .
 * 4. Between each following pair of vertices we can establish a >> slope << ,
 * which is just the the "a" in the eq. of linear form y = ax + b
 * 5. Now start drawing our polygon Row by Row From top to bottom .
 * Each Row has given the most left and rightmost tile due to use of both paths prepared before
 * -- Left path for tracing the most Leftmost Tile , Right path the most Rightmost Tile in each .
